# Building-Energy-Prediction

The main goal of this project is to predict the building KWH meter reading using building meta data(age, sq footage, usage,..), weather condition (dew temprature, wind, air temprature,..)
and time of the year.

Several cleaning method were applied and the 3 different data set provided by ASHRAE were merged
ANN from Tensorflow was deployed, however the model did not converge.
